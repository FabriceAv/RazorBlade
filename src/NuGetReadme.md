# RazorBlade

**Compile Razor templates at build-time without a dependency on ASP.NET.**

RazorBlade is meant to be *lightweight* and *self-contained*: cshtml files are compiled into C# classes at build-time with a Roslyn source generator. No reference to ASP.NET is required.

See the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ltrzesniewski/RazorBlade) for more information.
